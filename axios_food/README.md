# Recipe Finder Application

## Overview

The Recipe Finder Application is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React that interacts with TheMealDB API to fetch and display recipes.
 This project helps users search for recipes and view detailed cooking instructions. 
 The application utilizes Axios for making API calls and React Router for navigation between different pages.

## Features

- **Search Recipes:** Users can search for recipes by name using a search bar.
- **View Recipe Details:** Users can view detailed information about a recipe, including ingredients and cooking instructions.
- **Default Recipes:** A list of default recipes is displayed on the homepage when no search query is provided.
- **Error Handling:** Appropriate error messages are displayed if there is an issue with the API call.

## User Journey:
